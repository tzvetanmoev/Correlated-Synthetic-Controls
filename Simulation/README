As described in the paper, the simulation proceeds in 3 stages:
1) Simulate the matrix with outcomes \Theta
2) Code the four different estimator
3) Compare their performance

Note that the process is fully automated by the creation of the following functions:
1) simulate_data_int_random_effects - simulates the data
2) run_did - runs feasible difference-in-differnece: it is also used for running infeasible did after some manipulation of matrix \Theta
3) run_pscm - codes the Penalised Synthetic Control of L'Hour and Abadie (2021)
4) run_rwscm - runs Correlated Synthetic Controls: the original name of the estimator before CSC was Random Weights Synthetic Control Method (RWSCM)
